## 🚀 About Me

After 14 years teaching STEM to diverse learners (K12, college, private/public schools, and even inmates in prison while I was incarcerated) I’m pivoting to the tech world as a software developer, with a deep focus on AI and agentic systems.

- 🎓 **Education:** BS Astronomy (UW Seattle), currently studying Information Technology & Application Development (ITAD) at Edmonds College
- 🧪 **STEM:** Ran open-lab makerspaces, taught Python, Arduino, CAD, & 3D Printing
- 🏫 **Learners:** From kids to college students, private/public schools, and prison populations
- 🧑‍💻 **Coder’s Journey:** Learned to code in prison via game development (Python → TCL/Tk → MERN)
- 🎮 **Game Dev:** Still passionate about making games! Favorite prison projects:  
  - **Chromotose:** Roguelike exploring Queer experience through light mechanics and puzzles  
  - **MTG:DB:** Magic: The Gathering card database & deck builder for custom cards

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (MERN), TCL/Tk
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, Node.js, React, Express
- **Other:** Arduino, CAD, 3D Printing
- **AI:** Agentic systems, subagent orchestration, prompt engineering, ML

## 🧠 Current Passions

- **AI & Agents:** Experimenting with agentic models, subagents, and context engineering
- **Game Development:** Always a gamer at heart (Overwatch #supportMain)  
- **Creative Automation:** Building author-assist tools -- automated creative writing teams for novel-writing & AI-driven procedural content generation

All of my experience as a STEM educator with a research background have prepared me to engage and orchestrate these models -- it's like wrangling 12-year old prodigies. So I've been heavily experimenting with subagents and context engineering. 

Ironically, while in prison, I would spend hours crafting the perfect prompts to send off in an email to get exactly the content I wanted. Now that I'm Out and can mainline the internet, directly engaging with these models, I'm far more mindful in how I construct my prompts and agent files.
